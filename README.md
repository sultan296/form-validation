# form-validation

In this project, I demonstrate a website featuring a fully functional contact form that incorporates JavaScript for validation. The form includes fields for name, phone number, email, and a message, each of which has specific validation requirements. Users will experience real-time feedback as they enter their information, with prompts for any necessary corrections. Additionally, the form is styled with appropriate error messages and visual cues for a seamless user experience.
